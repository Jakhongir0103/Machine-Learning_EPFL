# EPFL Machine Learning Course CS-433

This repository contains all lecture notes, labs and projects of the Machine Learning course I have taken at EPFL in Fall 2023, and is structured into the following sections:

### labs
Programming and theory exercises on the weekly course topics.

### lectures
Weekly lectures slides.

### exam 
Previous year's exams with the solutions.

### projects
Two projects we did throughout the course. The folders contain the projects description and the report we have written at the end of the project. In short, the _project 1_ is about building a classification model for medical data with only `numpy` library (the code can be found [here](https://github.com/Jakhongir0103/Cardiovascular-Diseases-Prediction)), and _project 2_ is about Fine-tuning LLMs for Argument Stance Detection task.
